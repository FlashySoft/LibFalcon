# Notes regarding LibAlloc Addon:

Durand Miller's Liballoc (https://github.com/durandmiller/liballoc) is provided with LibFalcon
as an addon. Uncomment the `include` line in the main makefile to use it. No core files of 
LibFalcon use Liballoc (as of now), so it is completely upon the user to use it however
he/she likes. It is released under the GNU GPL v3.
