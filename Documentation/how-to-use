# How to Use LibFalcon

The LibFalcon library is a culmination of various useful C functions that are needed by
low-level programs and Hobbyist kernels. These are the few simple steps you need
to follow in order to use the library.

1. Implement routines needed by LibFalcon in your kernel source code. (see ./hooks)

2. Review the Makefile on the LibFalcon source code's root folder. Add/remove addons
provided by Libfalcon (Like the textmode routines) and run `make`.

3. After the compilation has finished, you should see a directory named 'OUT' in the project
root. This directory contains an 'include' subdirectrory and the libfalcon.a file.

4. Copy the includes/ directory to your kernel's source code directory; this will serve as the
include directory housing all the C/C++ heders you'll need. While Linkng your Kernel's 
source code, link the libfalcon.a library file along with all the object files of your kernel.
