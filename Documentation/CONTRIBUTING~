If you want to contribute to the development of LibFalcon, look at the TODO file.
After you have decided what you would do, prepare a patch with the changes and 
mail it to "warhacker.2002@gmail.com" . make the subject "PATCH FOR LIBFALCON", 
or your mail (in addition to your hardwork) may go un-noticed. If your work is 
good enough, I will include your code in the project and write your name in the 
CREDITS file.
