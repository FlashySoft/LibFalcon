# Notes regarding Text Mode addon:

As of now, the Textmode printing routines are provided with libfalcon. Simple functions like 
puts(), cls() are provided. All the functions are prefixed with `LF_` so that the given
routines don't clash with the user's own routines. If you don't want to use the screen routines 
implemented here to be bundled with the final libfalcon.a library, you can just comment out the 
line "include hooks/textmode/makefile". LibFalcon works perfectly well without it.

However, you might want to remove the libfalcon/textmode.h header from your final includes/ 
directory.
